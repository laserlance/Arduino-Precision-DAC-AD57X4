/*
     Because in this example I'm only using two DACs, I initialize the DAC object with 2 and select the desired
     voltage range.
     
     Voltage selections are:
     
          1 = 0-5V
          2 = 0-10V
          3 = 0-10.8V
          4 = -5-5V
          5 = -10-10V
          6 = -10.8-10.8V
          
           ******************************IMPORTANT NOTE******************************************
          
          You need to make provisions on your shield for the LDAC pin and the CLR pin. You can tie the LDAC pin to permanant low if you
          wish for the DAC outputs to be updated as soon as their values are received, or you can tie the LDAC pin to a digital output on
          the Arduino. This library assumes that this pin is tied low permanantly and, as such, does not have provisions for it. For the CLR pin, 
          you will need to tie it to a pullup resistor if you never wish to clear the DAC outputs via hardware. You could also tie this to a digital 
          output on the Arduino if you wished to control this through hardware. Please see the data sheet for the actual pin numbers of the DAC chip 
          you are using.
